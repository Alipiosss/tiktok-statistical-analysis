# 📊 TikTok Statistical Analysis

This project was developed as part of the **Google Advanced Data Analytics Certificate (Course 4 – The Power of Statistics)**.

## 🎯 Objective

To investigate whether there is a statistically significant difference in the average number of video views between verified and unverified TikTok accounts.

## 🧪 Methodology

- Conducted **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
- Computed **descriptive statistics**  
- Performed a **two-sample t-test** (Welch's t-test)  
- Chose a significance level of **0.05**  
- Interpreted the **p-value** and **t-statistic**  

## 📈 Key Findings

- **Unverified accounts had significantly higher average views** than verified accounts.
- The **p-value < 0.0001**, which allowed us to **reject the null hypothesis**.
- This suggests that verification status may not directly correlate with higher visibility.
- Additional variables (such as content type, frequency, or algorithmic influence) may better explain performance.

## 💡 Next Steps

- Develop a **logistic regression model** to explore patterns in engagement and claim status.
- Investigate other predictors such as author ban status, video duration, or content characteristics.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- Python  
  - `pandas` for data manipulation  
  - `scipy.stats` for hypothesis testing  
  - `seaborn` and `matplotlib` for visualization
